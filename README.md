# Flight Performance & Aviation Analytics

## Introduction
The **Flight Analytics Project** aims to analyze flight delays, cancellations, and airport performance using real-world aviation data. Disruptions in air travel significantly impact airline operations, customer satisfaction, and overall efficiency. This project leverages **SQL-based data extraction** and **Power BI visualizations** to uncover trends and provide insights that can drive better decision-making.

## Problem Statement
As a **Data Analyst at AeroStat Airlines**, I analyzed flight punctuality, cancellations, route efficiency, and passenger experience to help the airline optimize operations. The company faced challenges in:
- **Flight delays & cancellations**
- **Route efficiency & congestion**
- **Passenger experience & satisfaction**

## Project Phases
### Phase 1: SQL Analysis
Using **MySQL**, I performed various analyses to extract meaningful insights, including:
- **Flight Delay Analysis**: Understanding average delays in departure & arrival
- **Most Frequent Routes**: Identifying the top 10 busiest flight routes
- **Airline Performance Ranking**: Ranking airlines based on their on-time performance
- **Cancellation Trends**: Determining the leading causes of cancellations
- **Airport Congestion Analysis**: Identifying airports with the highest traffic
- **Weather-Related Disruptions**: Examining the impact of weather on delays & cancellations
- **Day-of-Week & Seasonal Trends**: Identifying the best and worst travel times
- **Hub Efficiency**: Determining major hub airports based on connectivity

### Phase 2: Dashboard Creation
Developed an **interactive Power BI dashboard** featuring:
- **Interactive Filter Panel** for better data exploration
- **Page Navigation** to simplify dashboard usability
- **Key Performance Metrics** for airline and airport performance

### Phase 3: Insight Report
Based on SQL analysis and dashboard findings:
- **Average Departure Delay**: ~15 mins | **Average Arrival Delay**: ~13 mins
- **Most Frequent Route**: **LAX-JFK** (118 flights)
- **Best On-Time Airline**: **Virgin America (VX) - 5 mins avg. delay**
- **Highest Cancellation Reason**: **Weather (Reason B) - 551 cancellations**
- **Busiest Airport**: **Atlanta (ATL) - 5,891 flights**
- **Peak Travel Month**: **January (49,999 flights, 28.48 mins avg. delay)**
- **Best On-Time Day**: **Thursday (14.44 mins avg. delay)**
- **Airline with Worst Delays**: **Frontier Airlines (F9) - 54.8 mins avg. delay**

## Recommendations
1. **Reduce Flight Cancellations**
   - **Invest in Weather Forecasting** for better scheduling.
   - **Optimize Maintenance & Crew Scheduling** to reduce airline-related cancellations.
2. **Optimize Airport Operations**
   - **Expand Infrastructure** at high-traffic airports (ATL, DFW, ORD).
   - **Leverage AI-driven Scheduling** to reduce congestion.
3. **Improve On-Time Performance**
   - **Streamline Turnaround Processes** to minimize ground delays.
   - **Target High-Delay Airlines (Frontier, Spirit)** for efficiency improvements.
4. **Enhance Passenger Experience**
   - **Upgrade In-Flight Services** for better customer satisfaction.
   - **Improve Communication During Delays** to build customer trust.

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into **flight performance trends**, **delay & cancellation patterns**, and **airport efficiency**, enabling airlines to improve operations and enhance passenger experience. The **interactive Power BI dashboard** further empowers stakeholders with real-time insights.
